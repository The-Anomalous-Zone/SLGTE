Shot counter ~ Shot counter. The experimental method was particularly useful for high-capacity magazines.
standart barrel ~ a standard barrel without a mouth.
Longer barrel ~ increases the overall range of the weapon, but reduces movement due to weight and length.
barriers ~ sound guide The size of the trap body decreased, but the weight and length of the weapon increased.
